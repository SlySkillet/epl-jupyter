# UnderStat scraper

I'm building this to create a more modular Jupyter Notebook project for my statistics exploration. This will all break out into a sepparate repository.

## Goals:

- create a scraper module
- use the scraper module in a reusable notebook for calculating 1 x 2 probabilities for a given Premier League matchup
