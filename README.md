# EPL JUPYTER

# Premier League Probability Analysis

## Overview
This repository allows users to scrape, process, and analyze English Premier League match data. Users can calculate probabilities for 1 x 2 match results and over/under goals using statistical modeling.

Alternatively, analysis for upcoming and past matches can be viewed in the output directory. They are named by the matchup and in directories by date eg. `output/12-14-24/ars_v_evt.ipynb`. This project began midway through the 2024-2025 season.

All probabilities are currently based on *this season's results*. If you choose to gamble, do so with caution and remember that *all models are wrong, some are useful*.

Good luck and have fun ðŸš€

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or later
2. Jupyter Lab
3. Browser to access Jupyter Lab

## Workflow Instructions
The analysis involves three Jupyter notebooks located in the `/notebooks` directory. Follow these steps:

### Notebook 1: `01_scrape_data.ipynb`
#### Purpose:
Scrapes match data from Understat and saves it as raw CSV files in the `data/raw/` directory.

#### Instructions:
1. Open `01_scrape_data.ipynb`.
2. Run all cells (`Run All` or press `Shift + Enter`).
3. Confirm that `data/raw/home_table.csv` and `data/raw/away_table.csv` are updated.
4. Proceed to `02_process_data.ipynb`.

---

### Notebook 2: `02_process_data.ipynb`
#### Purpose:
Processes raw match data to calculate metrics needed for probability analysis.

#### Instructions:
1. Open `02_process_data.ipynb`.
2. Run all cells (`Run All` or press `Shift + Enter`).
3. Verify processed data is saved to:
   - `data/processed/home_table.csv`
   - `data/processed/away_table.csv`
4. Proceed to `03_analysis_template.ipynb`.

---

### Notebook 3: `03_analysis_template.ipynb`
#### Purpose:
Performs probability calculations for a specific match and generates insights.

#### Instructions:
1. Open `03_analysis_template.ipynb`.
2. Ensure all cells in `01_scrape_data.ipynb` and `02_process_data.ipynb` have been run.
3. Define the `home_side` and `away_side` in the first cell.
4. Run all cells (`Run All` or press `Shift + Enter`).
5. View the calculated probabilities and projections in the final cell.
6. Optionally:
   - Copy the notebook to `output/<matchday_directory>/`.
   - Rename the file for match-specific analysis.
